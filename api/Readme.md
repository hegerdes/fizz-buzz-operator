# API Guidelines
This directory contains all the API definitions which will generate the needed CRDs.

## Generation
To generate the CRDs and the code scaffold run `make`

## Validations
You can set OpenAPI validations for properties. These are set as comments in the type-spec. A list of all validations can be found here: https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers/crd-validation
